msgid "``site`` is automatically imported each time the interpreter starts up.  On import, it extends ``sys.path`` with site-specific names constructed by combining the prefix values ``sys.prefix`` and ``sys.exec_prefix`` with several suffixes.  The prefix values used are saved in the module-level variable ``PREFIXES`` for reference later.  Under Windows, the suffixes are an empty string and ``lib/site-packages``.  For Unix-like platforms, the values are ``lib/python$version/site-packages`` (where ``$version`` is replaced by the major and minor version number of the interpreter, such as ``3.5``) and ``lib/site-python``."
