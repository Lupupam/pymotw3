msgid "Python virtual environments, managed by ``venv``, are set up for installing packages and running programs in a way that isolates them from other packages installed on the rest of the system. Because each environment has its own interpreter executable and directory for installing packages, it is easy to create environments configured with various combinations of Python and package versions all on the same computer."

msgid "Each virtual environment contains a ``bin`` directory, where the local interpreter and any executable scripts are installed, an ``include`` directory for files related to building C extensions, and a ``lib`` directory, with a separate ``site-packages`` location for installing packages."

# 067f8b13536d41a8a04dabaec1d4147b
msgid "The default ``bin`` directory contains \"activation\" scripts for several Unix shell variants. These can be used to install the virtual environment on the shell's search path to ensure the shell picks up programs installed in the environment. It's not necessary to activate an environment to use programs installed into it, but it can be more convenient."

msgid "Finally, the environment includes a ``pyvenv.cfg`` file with settings describing how the environment is configured and should behave. The ``home`` variable points to the location of the Python interpreter where ``venv`` was run to create the environment. ``include-system-site-packages`` is a boolean indicating whether or not the packages installed outside of the virtual environment, at the system level, should be visible inside the virtual environment. And ``version`` is the Python version used to create the environment."

msgid "Virtual environments are commonly used to run different versions of programs or to test a given version of a program with different versions of its dependencies. For example, before upgrading from one version of Sphinx to another, it is useful to test the input documentation files using both the old and new versions. To start, create two virtual environments."
