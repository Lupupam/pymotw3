msgid "When sending multi-byte binary data between two systems, it is important to ensure that both sides of the connection know what order the bytes are in and how to assemble them back into the correct order for the local architecture.  The server program uses the same ``Struct`` specifier to unpack the bytes it receives so they are interpreted in the correct order."

msgid "The floating point value loses some precision as it is packed and unpacked, but otherwise the data is transmitted as expected.  One thing to keep in mind is that depending on the value of the integer, it may be more efficient to convert it to text and then transmit, instead of using ``struct``.  The integer ``1`` uses one byte when represented as a string, but four when packed into the structure."
