msgid "Python 3 uses a global lock to prevent separate threads from corrupting the interpreter state.  After a configurable time interval, bytecode execution is paused and the interpreter checks if any signal handlers need to be executed. During the same check, the global interpreter lock (GIL) is also released by the current thread and then reacquired, with other threads given priority over the thread which has just released the lock."

# 75c464d767154c45a3b0dc77fc09efa5
msgid "The default switch interval is 5 milliseconds and the current value can always be retrieved with ``sys.getswitchinterval()``.  Changing the interval with ``sys.setswitchinterval()`` may have an impact on the performance of an application, depending on the nature of the operations being performed."

msgid "When the switch interval is less than the amount of time a thread takes to run to completion, the interpreter gives another thread control so that it runs for a while.  This is illustrated in the first set of output where the interval is set to 1 millisecond."

# c6f4621885314ba5a349afa7f07bfea8
msgid "For longer intervals, the active thread will be able to complete more work before it is forced to release control. This is illustrated by the order of the name values in the queue in the second example using an interval of 10 milliseconds."

# d8e7036496cb48a78879bb272c77b300
msgid "Many factors other than the switch interval may control the context switching behavior of Python's threads.  For example, when a thread performs I/O it releases the GIL and may therefore allow another thread to take over execution."

msgid "Since **Thread-1** does not sleep, it finishes before its status is checked.  Since it is no longer active, it does not appear in the output.  **Thread-2** acquires the lock ``blocker``, then sleeps for a short period.  Meanwhile **Thread-3** tries to acquire ``blocker`` but cannot because **Thread-2** already has it."
