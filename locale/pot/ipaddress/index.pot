msgid "A network is defined by a range of addresses. It is usually expressed with a base address and a mask indicating which portions of the address represent the network, and which portions are remaining to represent addresses on that network. The mask can be expressed explicitly, or using a prefix length value as in the example below."

msgid "Iterating over the network yields addresses, but not all of them are valid for hosts. For example, the base address of the network and the broadcast address are both included. To find the addresses that can be used by regular hosts on the network, use the ``hosts()`` method, which produces a generator."
