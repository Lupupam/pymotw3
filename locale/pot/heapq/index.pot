msgid "A *heap* is a tree-like data structure in which the child nodes have a sort-order relationship with the parents. *Binary heaps* can be represented using a list or array organized so that the children of element N are at positions 2 * *N* + 1 and 2 * *N* + 2 (for zero-based indexes). This layout makes it possible to rearrange heaps in place, so it is not necessary to reallocate as much memory when adding or removing items."
