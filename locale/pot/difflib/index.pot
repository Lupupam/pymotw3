msgid "The ``Differ`` class works on sequences of text lines and produces human-readable *deltas*, or change instructions, including differences within individual lines.  The default output produced by ``Differ`` is similar to the ``diff`` command-line tool under Unix.  It includes the original input values from both lists, including common values, and markup data to indicate which changes were made."
