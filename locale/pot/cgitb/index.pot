msgid "``cgitb`` is a valuable debugging tool in the standard library.  It was originally designed for showing errors and debugging information in web applications and was later updated to include plain-text output as well, but unfortunately was never renamed.  This has led to obscurity, and the module is not used as often as it could be."

msgid "If a function or method includes a lot of in-line comments, whitespace, or other code that makes it very long, then having the default of five lines of context may not provide enough direction. When the body of the function is pushed out of the code window displayed, there is not enough context to understand the location of the error.  Using a larger context value with ``cgitb`` solves this problem.  Passing an integer as the ``context`` argument to ``enable()`` controls the amount of code displayed for each line of the traceback."

The earlier examples all shows plain text output.  To produce HTML instead, leave out the ``format`` argument (or specify ``\"html\"``).  Most modern web applications are constructed using a framework that includes an error reporting facility, so the HTML form is largely obsolete."
