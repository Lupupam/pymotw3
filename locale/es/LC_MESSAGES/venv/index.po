"Python virtual environments, managed by ``venv``, are set up for "
"installing packages and running programs in a way that isolates them from"
" other packages installed on the rest of the system. Because each "
"environment has its own interpreter executable and directory for "
"installing packages, it is easy to create environments configured with "
"various combinations of Python and package versions all on the same "
"computer."

"Finally, the environment includes a ``pyvenv.cfg`` file with settings "

"packages`` is a boolean indicating whether or not the packages installed "
"outside of the virtual environment, at the system level, should be "
"visible inside the virtual environment. And ``version`` is the Python "
"version used to create the environment."
